Set up a proper development workflow:

For frontend-only changes, use cd frontend && bun run serve
For backend-only changes, use cd backend && mvn spring-boot:run
For full-stack development, use the start script

After implementing all these fixes, you have a much more robust Spring Boot and Vue.js project setup. Here's what you can do next:

Test the full build process to ensure everything works properly:
bashCopymvn clean install
This should install dependencies, build the frontend, copy the frontend resources to the backend, and compile the backend.
Start the application using your improved start script:
bashCopy./start.sh  # Make sure it's executable with chmod +x start.sh
This will launch both the backend and frontend with proper error handling.
Access your application in a web browser:

Frontend: http://localhost:8080
Backend API: http://localhost:8098/api
